** TODO metanet collision detection tutorial

** TODO snomaN Gaming - Good Game Design - Volgarr The Viking - The 'Isolation' Principle
   Introduce a new enemy in a controlled environment, so they can
   learn about how it behaves before being forced to deal with it in a
   painful way.   

   Each level has three difficulties of enemies:
   - green is easy
   - blue is medium
   - red is hardest.

   They always appear in this order. And they always appear by
   themselves so you can focus on just one at the beginning. Sometimes
   it even shows you the way one attacks in a way that can't
   possibly hurt you.

   The same thing can happen with environmental effects, like bouncing
   off glowing balls by doing a down-slash, which you discover by
   making it unavoidable in a vertical corridor and using a ladder
   that you have to press down to traverse.

   The final levels of the game are difficult because they combine
   enemies of each type together at the same time.

   --

   This can be done algorithmically by ensuring to generate them in
   certain orders and to track what the player has done before. You
   can also (boringly?) create little tutorial spaces where the
   enemies appear by themselves. This is a fair but "meaningless" and
   "artificial" way to do it. 
** TODO snomaN Gaming - Good Game Design - The Legend of Zelda - The 'Growing Stronger' Principle
   The game blocks a path and makes sure you see what you can't do,
   and makes you go back with more skills. This makes you feel
   stronger because you can do things that you wanted to do
   before. Also, it can make the game feel more connected and
   interesting because these blockages go somewhere and it makes a
   "Hard" area connected to an "Easy" area.

   Normally we think of this related to Movements skills (like
   Metroid), but you can do the same thing with difficult enemies and
   bosses.

   --

   This can be done by designing the map with overlapping paths and
   placing "gates" with a variant of graph-coloring.
** TODO snomaN Gaming - Good Game Design - Shovel Knight - The 'Teaching Without Teaching' Principle
   Annoying unskip-able teaching tutorials and text boxes.

   An intro level where you have to do each thing in the game in order
   and a safe way.

   This can help you discover new movement mechanics, like locking the
   "bounce" animation when you barely press the down in Shovel
   Knight.

   Progressive levels, rather than throwing everything at you at the
   same time.

   --

   The key idea is to make the tutorial Fun, so you want to play and
   learn how to play more.
** TODO UI effects - analog meter of range of connections with alpha fading
   Rather than something binary.

   (World of Goo)
** TODO visual effects - stretch objects along the velocity vector to emphasize and show movements
   (World of Goo)
** TODO visual effects - have elements look different before and while they behave differently
   140 has static things as rectangles, moving things as triangles
   pointing in the direction they will go, and when something is about
   to change it turns into static that gets more staticy as its gets
   closer to moving.

   In "* Souls" the enemies have "tells" that they do before they are
   about to act. In older games, this can be just a "blink" by
   switching the palette for a little bit.

   [This is different than just having nice animations, because it is
   about training the player's expectations.]
** TODO Juice it or Lose It notes
   - Maximum output for minimum output
   
   Effects
   - Add color
   - Tweening/easing functions (lots of little functions)
     + Start Point -> End Point with Time and equation
     + x += (target - x) * .1 [move 10%... slows down over time]
     + Good for things appearing on screen
     + If you go passed your target, then you bounce back
     + If you go backwards, then you also bounce during the process
     + If you add a random delay to each instance, then things look
       different and interesting
   - Stretch the paddle based on the movement
   - Add scaling when the ball interacts
   - Add rotation in the direction of movement
   - If you use a sin wave on the scaling, then it wobbles
   - If you change color when you interact, then you feel the
     interaction
   - Add a tweening effect to everything when there is any
     interacted. This is like screen-shake, but for the elements in
     the scene.
   - Sound effects for everything
   - You can't ever have too many particles
     + Smoke and other particles when you hit something
     + Animate when things are removed (scaling to nothing, fall off
       screen, spin, shatter)
   - Draw a line over where the ball has been
     + Change the color of this on some circumstances
   - Slow motion when something cool happens
   - Screen shake! The ball is now a comet
   - Personality
     + Add eyes to anything (make them react... winking, blinking,
       look towards the ball)
     + Add a smile when it hits something
     + Frown when the ball is far away
     + Big eyes are always better
   - Flash the background color
** TODO The Art of Screenshake notes
   Starting from a lame run-and-gun game. Make it amazing in 30 simple
   steps.

   1. Basic animations and sound (SFXR)
      The sound makes shooting feel better
   2. Lower enemy HP - It's more fun to kill
   3. Higher rate of fun - It's more fun to shoot
   4. Put more enemies - So you can shoot more
   5. Bigger bullets - Make it so you can see the bullet. It's
      fun. The size of your chest
   6. Muzzle flash - The first frame of bullet sprite is a circle.
   7. Faster bullets - Feels better
   8. Less accuracy - The bullets look more real and it's fun to see
      something different (influences gameplay a little)
   9. Impact effects - Draw something on the wall so the bullet
      doesn't just disappear, but something happens. (A little "pff"
      thing.)
   10. Hit animation - Make the enemy flash when you hurt them
   11. Enemy knockback - Push the enemy a few pixels back when they
       get hit
   12. Permanence - Make it so the enemy stays on the screen in a dead
       form, and falls back in a cool way. There was combat
       here. Memory is big. Movies always have shoot-outs in bars so
       that misses hit something. You can put stuff in the game just
       so that something happens even when you miss.
   13. Camera Lerp - Have the camera slightly lag behind the player,
       so the screen isn't so fake
   14. Camera Position - Show more around you. The game is about
       shooting, so show mainly in front of you so you can see more
       stuff to shoot. Dynamic camera could go near the source of
       danger or something.
   15. Screen Shake - On action
   16. Player knockback - When you shoot, push yourself back a tiny
       bit. Gives a good feel. Makes you go slower. If a game has a
       button, give a reason not to press it all the time.
   17. Sleep - Pause the game for a few milliseconds when something
       important happens to emphasize that something cool is about to
       happen.
   18. Gun Delay - Make the gun (attachment)'s position slightly lag
       the player's posn so it moves around cooler
   19. Gun kick - Make the gun posn respond to shooting so it feels
       cooler.
   20. Strafe - Walk backwards while shooting, rather than turning.
   21. More permanence - Put shells in that stay around forever
   22. More bass - Add bass to sound effects so it is cooler.
   23. Super Machinegun - Spread shot, so why not? It's fun
   24. Random Explosion - Every once in a while, make an enemy's
       death cause an explosion that hurts everyone. Explosion is
       black circle then white circle.
   25. Faster Enemies - It feels like more action
   26. More enemies - It's more fun!
   27. Even higher rate of fire and more camera kick - Because you
       can. When you fire, move the camera back a little.
   28. Bigger explosion - Always have bigger explosions
   29. Even more permanence - The explosion has smoke that is fading
       away. This is just scratching the surface of what you could do.
   30. Gameplay & Meaning - Make it so that you get hit and it
       matters. (The guy gets hit, flies into the air in slow-mo, and
       it says "You were the monster the whole time.)
** TODO Remove the get-bonus menu
   I find the menu concept to be inelegant and ugly. I'd like to
   replace it with something that is more natural. One idea is to have
   each game level have an ending that connects to the next game. For
   instance, in a Mario level, you would go through a pipe and you may
   come out in a different game. I could still use an SRS database,
   but I would produce little connections between the games.

   For arcade/puzzle games (like Tennis), I could show the character
   you are controlling playing the game pressing buttons or something
   in the bottom, like Bust-a-Move.

   For games with configurations, like Final Fantasy or changing
   character attributes, I could use a Pause menu that resets the
   level.

   The biggest problem (and this is really a problem anyways) would be
   communicating that even though before you were playing Mario and
   even though the sprite is the same, you are now playing Castlevania
   and have different rules/physics/etc.
** TODO board game menu like Mario Party / Smash Tour
   connected to the above, it would possible to have a mario
   party-style board game to connect the various games together and
   provide multiplayer. you could play games simultaneously and
   compare scores or even add stuff to harass the other person.

** TODO multiplayer platformers like NSMBW
   it's annoying that the camera doesn't go to split-screen or expand

** TODO multiplayer modes
   parallel vs sequential/hot-seat -- do you play at the same time?

   interacting vs non-interacting -- do you interact when you play?
   (tetris can send blocks over, mario can bounce off each other)

   coop vs versus -- are you cooperating or fighting in your
   play/interaction? (this makes sense in sequential/non-interacting
   too because you could imagine comparing scores or continuing where
   the last one left off or sharing things)

   asymmetric vs symmetric -- are you doing the same thing (mario) or
   very similar (mario 2/3d world) or different things (planning
   attacks versus executing them / laying out stage / etc)

** TODO NGL - tennis - it seems like the ball goes too low
   Also, if you try to bring the paddle to the top, it doesn't draw
   the whole way
** TODO NGL - Investigate the interaction of depth testing with transparency
   At the very least, I should be able to have fully opaque or fully
   transparent texture colors and get it to work. It is possible that
   I will have to call discard() in the fragment shader to ignore the
   effect on the depth buffer of the fully transparent texture

   Ideally, I'd be able to draw every sprite from back to front and
   get perfect transparencies.

   It might be more feasible to make layers something NGL knows about
   and have it draw each layer into a separate screen-sized texture
   that are all blended together afterward. (The SNES had only one
   layer that could be transparent over the others.)

   Also, here's another idea that uses front-to-back drawing order:
   http://my.opera.com/Vorlath/blog/2008/01/15/opengl-drawing-2d-transparent-objects-front-to-back

   Investigate this.

** TODO libretro - what if I used libretro rather than GLFW?

   CLOSED: [2012-09-09 Sun 23:43]
   I have begun experimenting with this a lot.
   
   --Why--
   
   [[http://www.opengl.org/wiki/FAQ#Are_glTranslate.2FglRotate.2FglScale_hardware_accelerated.3F][This FAQ]] says that OpenGL doesn't accelerate the fixed-function
   pipeline any longer. [[http://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/25411/basics-of-drawing-in-2d-with-opengl-3-shaders][This StackOverflow question]] suggests a general
   structure. ([[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1556535/using-opengl-to-accelerate-2d-graphics?rq%3D1][This one]] also talks about the same stuff.)
   
   --Plan--
   
   My original plan was to have a single vector input to the shader
   that was something like:
   
   Translation: XY
   Scale:       XY    (relative to the sprite, not the scene)
   Rotation:    Theta (relative to the sprite, not the scene)
   Color:       RGBA
   Rectangle:   WH
   Texture:     XYWH
   
   where the vertex shader would move the basis of the vertex, which is
   0,0 to the translated point, where it would then be scaled and
   rotated.
   
   the geometry shader would take this input and output the various
   vertexes for a rectangle ([[http://openglbook.com/the-book/chapter-2-vertices-and-shapes/][this site]] talks about you need 6 for
   GL_TRIANGLES but only 5 for GL_TRIANGLE_STRIP, but I don't know if
   you can do that in a geometry shader)
   
   the fragment shader would take the texture coordinates and grab the
   pixels, blending in the color. For most sprites, I would set the
   color to blank-ness and for opaque boxes, I would set the texture
   coordinates to a blank place.
   
   I hope this will allow me to have a single draw call.
   
   -- Populating it --
   
   My plan is to populate this vector by first, sorting the sprites
   into their layers with the background towards the front of the
   array. (My assumption is that background layers change less so it
   will make the vector more stable.) The game would return, basically,
   a list of rows of this vector and the engine would map through
   them. However, it would keep track of what the previous lists were
   and if they were eq? and in the same order, then they would not be
   set! to decrease memory traffic.
   
   I would assume that most translations, scaling, or rotations are not
   stacked, so it is safe to compose them on the CPU.
   
   -- Texture Atlas ---
   
   Additionally, I would have a single texture for all sprites in the
   game that was always available. This is called a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texture_atlas][Texture atlas]]. My
   idea is to write a library that scans the directory Get Bonus is in
   for all PNGs and stitches them together in a lossless way, doing
   something basic for limiting the area, with the opportunity for
   optimization later. This library would run at the start of every
   startup and find the list of files and their checksums and see if
   the cached PNG is still up to date. Similarly, this same program
   would create PNGs for fonts.
   
   I'm imaging an interface like
   
   texture-coords : path -> coordinates
   
   where the path would be relative to the Get Bonus directory and then
   the coordinates would be in the atlas that was constructed.
   
   I'd write a tool that would rip sprite sheets apart into their
   pieces.
   
   -- Notes --
   
   I've decided to go with Cg rather than GLSL directly, because of its
   separate compiler, seems to have good optimization technology, etc.
   
   Most of Nvidia's materials seem to be very good (particularly the
   manuals and examples that come with the toolkit.) [[http://filthypants.blogspot.com/2011/06/cg-shader-tutorial-for-emulators.html][Here's another]]
   source for tutorials.
   
   My current development machine is limited to OpenGL 3.2, which is
   relevant to developing with Cg. I've written a basic FFI for Cg with
   just what I need. It would be nice if there were spec files like
   RacketGL uses for OpenGL.
   
   -- Problems --
   
   First, my idea for the layout will be complicates because
   glVertexAttribPointer function can only give vertexes with 1 through
   4 elements, not this many. I might able to do it as one big thing
   anyways, by using strides and multiple attributes. (I could even do
   a different attribute for each piece.)
   
   Second, I don't totally understand the capabilities of geometry
   shaders. Essentially what I'm doing is telling OpenGL that there is
   only 1 "vertex" but then I'm expanding it into 6 by the geometry
   shader. (In the call to glDrawArray, will I put in the number of
   objects, or the number of objects times 6? Probably just the
   number?) [[http://www.opengl.org/wiki/Tutorial4:_Using_Indices_and_Geometry_Shaders_(C_/SDL)][This tutorial]] might be a good place to start. (Also, there
   are a few examples in the Nvidia CG toolkit.)
   
   Third, my initial attempts at following [[http://openglbook.com/the-book/chapter-2-vertices-and-shapes/][this tutorial]] to get things
   up in running (exp/pipe.rkt) has failed with my three rectangle
   example. First, rectangles don't show up at all. Instead, a triangle
   does. There's also a problem that only one triangle does---the front
   most one. Second, they aren't appearing in the place that I expect
   them to. I think [[http://www.opengl.org/wiki/FAQ#How_to_render_in_pixel_space][this FAQ question]] is a piece of the answer. I think
   I should start from scratch and adapt his example directly (to
   compare the drawings, for example) and go from there. ([[http://www.songho.ca/opengl/gl_vertexarray.html][This is
   another tutorial]] that may be useful.)
   
   I'm not totally certain about what the right thing to do with the
   blending between alpha, the color, and the texture color. [[http://www.opengl.org/discussion_boards/showthread.php/166520-Alpha-blending-with-Cg-shaders][Here's a
   thread]] that might have information. I also think I need to use
   (glShadeModel GL_FLAT) so that the color isn't interpolated.
   
   This is a very frustrating thing to be doing. I feel like a 142
   student.
   
   -- Useful paths --
   
   CG documentation --- /usr/share/doc/nvidia-cg-toolkit
   CG examples --- /usr/lib/nvidia-cg-toolkit/examples/OpenGL
   
   I had to install nvidia-cg-toolkit from Nvidia directly
   (Cg-3.1_April2012_x86_64.deb) because the Ubuntu one was broken.

   -- Further investigation --

   I transliterated the code from the tutorial into Racket precisely,
   including using GLUT and everything. However, it is black. I
   originally assumed this was because of GLEW, but when I disable GLEW
   in the C code, it works, but not in my code. Mysterious.

   I used 'apitrace' to determine that the OpenGL calls the two
   programs were making were literally IDENTICAL. Still, they display
   differently. My current guess is that the vertex arrays are being
   populated differently.

   After doing some tracing on the C side, I see that the bytes in my
   vertex arrays are different than the ones on the C side. Yet, I'm
   using f32vectors, which are supposed to be _float arrays. Weird.

   ARRRRGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHH

   I mixed up the sign on a vector coordinate. The byte difference was
   just an error in printing on the C side.

   Alright, now that I have a working program, I have to go back to
   being in racket/gui or accept my new GLUT overlord. Or maybe GLFW?

   --- Progress 09/01 ---

   I've switched away from GLUT from the tutorial and switched to using
   Cg (seems like a good idea in some ways, performance and
   expressiveness, but a bad in others (less documentation it seems.))

   I've started to work on my custom shader. I've got it generating a
   quad from a single point (with six vertices).

   My next task is to work with textures. Right now I have the
   information being passed along, but I need to have three things:
   flat color quads, flat textured quads, and textured quads with a
   color blended on top. I think I will test with the Pac-Man sprite
   sheet. I think I need those examples before I can really try to
   write the code.

   --- Progress 09/02 ---

   Today I switched back to GLSL after reading about some problems
   with Cg and failing to get triangle strips to work. I find it
   really weird and annoying to write three files though, where the
   names of identifiers have to be the same. It's strange. But after I
   did the transition, then I was able to get the triangle strip
   working, so now I'm just generating 4 vertices, which is nice. Next
   up is texturing, which I've done a bit of.

   --- Progress 09/03 ---

   Basic textures are done. A few more things to do though. Changed the
   texture coordinate representation. Got indexed textures to work, but
   there's the annoying magic number length in the vertex shader. And
   I don't like the way I did it, but eh. What can you do? Just did
   rotation and scaling on the sprite level. Dramatically increased
   number of sprites to benchmark. 500 @ 60 FPS with just a transfer
   of the entire transform array. I tried to optimize by caching
   values and moving things into the vertex shader, but it did
   nothing. I wonder if geometry shaders are slow? I'm also interested
   to find out if rendering at the lower resolution would be better. I
   think I shouldn't worry about performance until after I apply it to
   the games.

   I tried to remove the Geometry Shader to improve performance. The
   first idea was to use Instanced drawing and draw 4 instances for
   each sprite (one for each corner); unfortunately, instancing is for
   meshes, not for vertices, so I couldn't use the instance id to
   identify the corner and assemble them together. So that failed.

   Next, I tried to generate 4 vertices per sprite on the CPU, but
   with all the exact same positions and then a uniform that contained
   which corner the vertex corresponded to. The first problem with
   this was that TRIANGLE_STRIP tries to connect every single sprite
   together, which is wrong. So, I changed to use glMultiDrawArrays
   with big s32vectors to identify the start of each strip. This was
   miserably slow.

   My next idea (not yet implemented) is to use glDrawElements where
   the indexes are always 0...LastSprite and the indexes are just the
   center positions and I still use a uniform to identify the
   corner. And I would use glPrimitiveRestartIndex to restart the strip
   up again.

   --- Progress 09/07 ---

   I implemented the glDrawElements with glPrimitiveRestartIndex and
   got 3 FPS with 1024 sprites. After going to a triangle-based
   rendering (so, six vertices per sprite), I was able to get 15 FPS
   with 1024 sprites (on my full laptop screen). 512 sprites is only
   20 or 30 FPS (slower than the geometry-shader based version.)

   When I added rotation, the performance didn't change. But when I
   added scaling in the shader it INCREASED! I can reliably do 1024
   sprites @ 30 FPS and 512 sprites @ over 60 FPS.

   Doing the corner calculation of hw/hh slowed it down to 30 FPS. So I
   reverted it. Same with a corner calculation of the tex coordinates,
   which means the index is pointless. I've now removed some of the
   extra stuff that supported all these experiments (the corner vertex
   array and the texture atlas index uniform. Didn't seem to have any
   effect on performance, but memory usage is down.) Now the shader is
   pretty dirt simple.

   After all this, I went back and checked out what the situation was
   with the geometry shader version that did everything on the
   card... and it gets the exact same performance. Argh! And it uses
   less memory to upload the scene!

   I think it is time to just implement this for the games and see
   what happens.

   Later that day I turned on depth testing and got super fast
   performance. Basically before I was drawing every single sprite over
   previously drawn ones, which cost a lot of time. Now the GPU can
   ignore "background" sprites that are covered. This will influence
   what order I sent them to the card and how I do
   blending/transparency/ etc. But I get insane performance, so it is
   probably worth it.

   Maybe change the texture mode to not blur?

   Can't use integers in fragment, because it's not a flat shade

   I tried to switch to POW-of-2 texture atlases... the code is
   simpler, which is nice and the blurring is not so bad, but it isn't
   fixed. I think this is a good change though, because I know I'll
   never have floating-point representation weirdness.

   I was able to get around this quite a lot, but it is still a bit

   I changed from using the "shelf" algorithm to the power-of-2 tree
   algorithm. The code in the texture-atlas is much nicer, although
   the actual pow2-bin-pack is pretty whack. It turns out that this is
   a worse implementation:

   - Original "shelf": 180K
   - Pow2 smallest-to-biggest: 192K
   - Pow2 biggest-to-smallest: 188K

   But I think I will keep it because I prefer it.

   What I would like to do in the future is:
   - define a better interface to different bin packers, so I can keep
     the texture atlas code in its current beautiful state.
   - use the above (and below) implementations (plus maybe the NP
     complete one?
   - find the best or try each of them and select the smallest.

   I made the interface and ended up implementing this:

   http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/210979/Fast-optimizing-rectangle-packing-algorithm-for-bu

   And I got down to 160K! I think it is probably basically optimal!

   I'll leave these ideas here for the millennium:

   I don't think it's a problem with CRT, because when I turn off that

   Although, when I turned off CRT altogether, it went away. My current
   assumption is that the scaling from CRT to full-screen is a
   non-integer amount, so I should fix it to restrict to integer
   amounts so that pixels are always doubled, tripled, etc.

   maybe the evector is getting too big? [nope, i added a printout and
   nothing happened]

   maybe I'm not really using the same graphics card memory and I'm
   doing lots of allocations? I tried to use dynamic versus stream. I
   tried to use buffersubdata. I feel like I don't have enough
   information about what's going on.

   maybe I should try the two FBO thing?

   http://hacksoflife.blogspot.com/2012/04/beyond-glmapbuffer.html

   http://www.gamedev.net/topic/517185-opengl-batch-rendering/

   2012/10/24 - When I turned off the CRT emulation, the problem
   happened much sooner. I think this is because of more stages in my
   pipeline, so more chance to have asynchrony. Maybe the two FBO
   thing will work, then?

   I don't understand why this wouldn't happen with my demos, such as
   the rotating sprites one, which change things just as much and I've
   run for just as long.

   Experiment with getting memory data from bugle

   http://www.gremedy.com/screenshots.php
   https://www.opengl.org/wiki/Debugging_Tools
   http://www.opengl.org/sdk/tools/BuGLe/

   2012/10/29 - I couldn't get information from bugle because
   NVPerfSDK only works on Windows. I went with the ranged buffer
   mapping with invalidation, but this required me to kill evector and
   do it more manually and ugly---to avoid going over the sprite data
   multiple times per frame, I expand the buffer the /next/ frame. I
   still am not doing unsynchronized access, which I think I could,
   but I'm not totally sure.

   CLOSED: [2012-10-29 Mon 22:20]

   fullscreen : (void -> void) 
                (key-event -> void)
             -> width height (void -> void)
                (string -> void)

   You give a drawing function, you give it a function that gets key
   events. It gives the max width, the max height, a function that
   forces a re-draw, and a function that updates the window
   lable. [Doesn't need OpenGL, but will call swap-buffers.] [Sets the
   viewport]

   aspect-draw : full-width full-height
                 aspect-width aspect-height max
              -> actual-width actual-height 
                 ((-> void) -> void)

   You give it the actual WxH of the screen and the desired aspect
   ratio (16:9) plus a maximum constant (such as 80 for 720p, which
   seems to be my laptop's maximum performance for the CRT shader) and
   it will return the actual width/height allocated for it, plus a
   function that receives a drawing function that is drawn on to the
   actual width/height screen and then put in the center of the real
   screen. In the future, this function could receive the rotation to
   have TATE built in. [Uses OpenGL natively] [Sets the viewport]

   draw-in-texture : texture-width texture-height
                  -> texture-id
                     ((-> void) -> void)

   (Used by aspect-draw) Using OpenGL, it calls a drawing function you
   give it later and draws into the texture. It returns the texture id
   before hand so you can use it. [Sets the viewport]

   draw-on-crt : crt-width crt-height
                 screen-width screen-height
              -> ((-> void) -> void)

   (Uses draw-in-texture) Using OpenGL and the CRT shader, calls the
   drawing function with a small texture [Sets the viewport] and then
   takes that texture and draws it to the default location (in our
   case, another texture) but with the CRT effect run out it. [In the
   future, modify this so that the final screen can be drawn in two
   passes for halation.]

   In the future, this will make it super easy to switch to GLFW,
   because only fullscreen is changed. Plus I think aspect-draw in
   OpenGL will be nicer than the margin hack I use now
